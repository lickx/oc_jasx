Simple app for switching outfits using the JasX outfit system  

Wearing the JasX HUD is mandatory for this app to work.  

It works just like the stock outfits, but uses the JasX system/folder.  
The following commands are prefixed with j to not clash with stock oc_rlvsuite:  

\<prefix\>jwear \<outfitname\>     switches outfits to '#RLV/JasX/\<outfitname\>'  
\<prefix\>joutfits               offers a list of Jasx outfits to choose from  

Additionally the following commands are available:  

\<prefix\>jasx                   opens the apps' main menu  

\<prefix\>dress                  opens the dress menu ('Dressed' in JasX)  
\<prefix\>undress                opens the undress menu ('Underwear' in JasX)  
\<prefix\>nude                   opens the nude menu ('Bits' in JasX)  

With dress, undress and nude you can select wich area it affects or  
wether all areas at once are affected. (Head, Arms, Torso, Groin, Boots in JasX)
